# Sandea Operations Analytics

## Problem
Sandea needs to analyze pricing and supply data across multiple product lines to optimize operations and improve profitability in 2025. Data is stored in various Excel sheets for different product categories (e.g., P3, P4, P5, P8) and a consolidated ALL_2025 workbook.

## Approach
- **Data consolidation:** Combine monthly and product-level Excel files into a single dataset.
- **Data cleaning:** Standardize column names, handle missing values, convert dates, and normalize price and quantity units.
- **Exploratory analysis:** Identify high-value customers, sales trends, and product mix.
- **Pricing analysis:** Compare customer-specific price lists (P3/P4/P5) with reference price lists to identify pricing opportunities.
- **Supply and inventory analysis:** Use product-level supply data to forecast demand and highlight potential stockouts.
- **Reporting & Visualization:** Create dashboards and charts in Excel or Python to summarize metrics.

## Results
The analysis identifies pricing anomalies, reveals seasonal demand patterns, and uncovers underperforming product lines. Recommendations include aligning prices with market averages, optimizing inventory levels for peak demand months, and focusing on high-margin customers.

## Industry relevance
This project demonstrates how operations and pricing analytics can support strategic decisions in retail supply chains. It is applicable to fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) sectors across the GCC region and Australasia.

## How to run
1. Upload the provided Excel datasets (`ALL_4_2025.xlsx`, `Sandea P3-2025 Customer (1).xlsx`, `Sandea-P5 2025.xlsx`, etc.) and Python scripts (`update_local_Paths.py`, `scrape_image_urls.py`) to this repository.
2. Use Jupyter or Excel to explore and analyze the data following the approach described above.
3. Generate your own dashboards or pivot tables to visualize results and share insights.
